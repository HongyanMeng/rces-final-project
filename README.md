### Hypothesis
Stringent policies are more effective in controlling the growth rate of COVID-19

### Summary
A cartopy map indicating the current confirmed cases around the globe.
Plot the growth rate curves for every country and examine how the tendency of the curves changes over time.
Determine the policy timelines for different countries and mark them on the growth rate curves to evaluate the effect of such policies
